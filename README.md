# Drum Website Project

In this project, I used native JavaScript to create simple logic for the website. Here’s a brief overview of how I approached it:

## Implementation

- I utilized a function that returns an object with a single key.
- I manipulated the DOM elements by applying the necessary event listeners.
- Using a `switch` statement, I checked which key the user pressed to trigger the appropriate sound.

And that’s it! The implementation is straightforward. I decided to practice my skills and share the results with you.

Feel free to explore the project and provide any feedback!
